# Problem 1

Load the data

``` r
homicide_data = read_csv("data_homicide/homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

The raw data has information on homicides in 50 large US cities gathered
by the *Washington Post* , including victims’ information (name, race,
age, sex), location where the homicide occured (city, state) and
disposition (closed/open with or without arrest).

Create a `city_state` variable and summarize within cities to obtain the
total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides

``` r
homicide_df = 
  homicide_data %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest"  ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arerst"         ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"       ~ "solved",
    )
  ) 
  
aggregate_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
     hom_total = n(),
     hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved", na.rm = TRUE), 
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate
the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of
prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull
the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting
tidy dataframe.

``` r
baltimore_hom =
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state %in% "Baltimore_MD") %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved)
```

A tidy dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each city
